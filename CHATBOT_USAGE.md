## Sample Questions

The chatbot can understand and respond to a wide range of questions:

### Disease Information
- "What is apple scab?"
- "Tell me about tomato late blight"
- "What causes powdery mildew?"
- "Explain black spot disease"
- "What is rust in plants?"

### Prevention Methods
- "How to prevent plant diseases?"
- "Ways to prevent apple scab"
- "Prevention methods for crop diseases"
- "How to avoid leaf curl"

### Treatment Recommendations
- "How to treat apple scab"
- "Treatment for tomato late blight"
- "What should I do about powdery mildew?"
- "Remedy for black spot"
- "Cure for citrus greening"

### Additional Topics
- "Fertilizer recommendations for crops"
- "How to deal with aphids"
- "Best watering practices for plants"
- "Tips for healthy soil"

## Customizing the Chatbot

The chatbot uses pattern matching to understand questions and provide appropriate responses. To add more capabilities:

1. Open `backend/app.py`
2. Find the `process_message` function
3. Add new patterns and responses to the `patterns` list

Example:
```python
# Add a new pattern for composting questions
(["compost", "composting", "organic matter"], 
 "Composting tips: 1) Mix green (nitrogen-rich) and brown (carbon-rich) materials, 2) Keep pile moist but not wet, 3) Turn regularly for aeration, 4) Wait 3-12 months for finished compost, 5) Use in garden beds, containers, or as a top dressing.")
```

## Enabling Text-to-Speech

The chatbot can use Google's Text-to-Speech API to provide spoken responses:

1. Install the optional TTS dependencies:
   ```
   pip install google-cloud-texttospeech google-auth
   ```

2. Add your Google API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   ```

3. Restart the backend server

## Troubleshooting

### Speech Recognition Issues
- Make sure your browser supports the Web Speech API (Chrome is recommended)
- Check that your microphone is working and properly connected
- Speak clearly and at a normal pace
- Try in a quieter environment if there's background noise

### Text-to-Speech Issues
- If you don't hear responses, check your device volume
- Make sure you've added a Google API key in the backend `.env` file and installed the required packages
- Some languages may have limited voice options
